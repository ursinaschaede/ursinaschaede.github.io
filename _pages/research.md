### Quota vs. Quality?  <br/>Long Term Impacts of a Gender Quota (JMP)

*joint with Ville Mankki*

Does increased representation of a minority group via a quota affect productivity? We study the effect of abolishing a 40% admissions quota for male primary school teachers in Finland on pupils’ long run outcomes. This reform cut the share male among new teachers by half as male applicants had lower academic scores on average. We show that removing the quota creates quasi-random variation in the local share of male teachers based on the timing of union-mandated teacher retirements by municipality. We then investigate how quota-induced changes in local teacher gender composition affect pupils’ outcomes in the long-run. Using comprehensive register data from 1988 to 2018, we find that being exposed to a higher share of male quota teachers during primary school increases pupils’ educational and labor force attainment at age 25 -- in spite of their teachers' lower academic achievement. These long term effects originate from consequential application patterns to post-compulsory education at age 16. As male teachers overall have a stronger math background, male quota teachers boost pupils' enrollment in STEM fields. Pupils of both genders benefit similarly from exposure to teacher teams with more quota men.

### The Long Run Impact of Funding for Public Education: <br/>Evidence from Land Grants in Illinois
<br />
Public education is attributed a key role in the development of modern economies. In this paper, I trace out both the immediate and long run effects of investment in human capital through funding for local public schools. I leverage a natural experiment in Illinois that endowed survey townships at the beginning of settlement with a fixed plot of land to finance expenditures for local schools. By exploiting the granular spatial distribution of undesirable land features, I isolate exogenous variation in township schooling endowments while keeping overall township resource endowments fixed. I first document that the spatial distribution of undesirable land features has a negative impact on both township schooling expenditures and endowments by 1858. Linking residents from full count Census data from 1860 – 1940 to their townships of residence and across Census years, I find that townships with higher schooling expenditures in 1858 quickly and persistently move ahead: they experience higher population growth and the occupation transformation away from a mostly agriculturally oriented local economy proceeds more quickly. I show that these effects are driven by school rich townships being able to attract more settlers moving to Illinois from within the US, and by avoiding brain drain from younger generations.

### Thinking about the future: Childbirth, Misperceptions and Maternal Labor Force Participation

*joint with Anne Brenøe, Ana Costa-Ramón and Michaela Slotwinski*

After having their first child, most Swiss women reduce their workload substantially. This has large consequences for their longer-term career prospects and financial well-being. However, it is unclear if couples are internalizing the long-term consequences of low or no labor force participation. In this project, we conduct a randomized controlled trial to study how providing objective information about these long-term costs affect expectant mothers’ labor-supply expectations and decisions.
