Does increased representation of a minority group via a quota affect productivity? We study the effect of abolishing a 40% admissions quota for male primary school teachers in Finland on pupils’ long run outcomes. This reform cut the share male among new teachers by half as male applicants on average had lower academic scores. We show that removing the quota creates quasi-random variation in the local share of male teachers based on the timing of union-mandated teacher retirements by municipality. We then investigate how quota-induced changes in local teacher gender composition affect pupils’ outcomes in the long-run. Using comprehensive register data from 1988 to 2018, we find that being exposed to a higher share of male quota teachers during primary school increases pupils’ educational and labor force attainment at age 25. These long term effects originate from consequential application patterns to post-compulsory education at age 16. Pupils are more likely to directly continue education and to get allocated their preferred study choices. Pupils of both genders benefit similarly from exposure to teacher teams with more quota men.
