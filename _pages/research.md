###  [Quota vs. Quality? Long Run Impacts of a Gender Quota (Job Market Paper)](https://ursinaschaede.github.io/files/JMP_Schaede.pdf)
*joint with Ville Mankki*

We investigate the potential equity-efficiency trade-offs from gender quotas by studying the effect of abolishing a 40% quota for male primary school teachers on pupils’ long run outcomes in Finland. The quota had advantaged academically lower-scoring male applicants in university admissions, and its removal cut the share of men among new teachers by half. We show that combining this reform with the timing of union-mandated teacher retirements creates quasi-random variation in the local share of male teachers. We then document how quota-induced changes in local teacher gender composition affect pupils’ outcomes in the long run. Using comprehensive register data up to early adulthood, we find that pupils exposed to a higher share of male quota teachers during primary school have higher educational and labor force attainment at age 25. Pupils of both genders benefit similarly from exposure to male quota teachers. Our findings are consistent with male quota teachers contributing with valuable qualities to school environments that are not sufficiently captured by the teacher selection process in absence of the quota.

### The Long Run Effects of Funding for Public Education: Evidence from Land Grants in Illinois
<br />
Public education is attributed a key role in the development of modern economies. In this paper, I trace out both the immediate and long run effects of investment in human capital through funding for local public schools. I leverage a natural experiment in Illinois that endowed survey townships at the beginning of settlement with a fixed plot of land to finance expenditures for local schools. By exploiting the granular spatial distribution of undesirable land features, I isolate exogenous variation in township schooling endowments while keeping overall township resource endowments fixed. I first document that the spatial distribution of undesirable land features has a negative impact on both township schooling expenditures and endowments by 1858. Linking residents from full count Census data from 1860 – 1940 to their townships of residence and across Census years, I find that townships with higher schooling expenditures in 1858 quickly and persistently move ahead: they experience higher population growth and the occupation transformation away from a mostly agriculturally oriented local economy proceeds more quickly. I show that these effects are driven by school rich townships being able to attract more settlers moving to Illinois from within the United States, and by avoiding brain drain from younger generations.

### Thinking about the Future: Childbirth, Misperceptions and Maternal Labor Force Participation

*joint with Anne Brenøe, Ana Costa-Ramón and Michaela Slotwinski*

After having their first child, most Swiss women reduce their workload substantially. This has large consequences for their longer-term career prospects and financial well-being. However, it is unclear if couples are internalizing the long-term consequences of low or no labor force participation. In this project, we conduct a randomized controlled trial to study how providing objective information about these long-term costs affect expectant mothers’ labor-supply expectations and decisions.
