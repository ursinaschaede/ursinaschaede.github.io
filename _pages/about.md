Welcome!

I am a PhD candidate at the Economics department at the University of Zurich. I am on the 2021/22 Economics job market.


My work as an applied microeconomist focuses on topics regarding labor markets, education and gender. In my job market paper,
I analyze the long term impacts of a gender quota for male primary school teachers in Finland on their pupils' long run outcomes.
