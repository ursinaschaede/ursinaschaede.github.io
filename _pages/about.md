## Welcome!

<br/>
I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Economics at MIT for 2022/23 and will subsequently join the Department of Economics at Tufts University as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2023.

As an applied microeconomist, I study labor markets with a focus on education and gender.
