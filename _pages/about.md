<br/><br/>

## Welcome!

<br/>
I have graduated with a PhD in Economics from the University of Zurich. I will be an SNSF post doc at MIT for 2022/23 and subsequently join the Department of Economics at Tufts University as an Assistant Professor.

As an applied microeconomist, I study labor markets with a focus on education and gender. In my job market paper,
I analyze the long term impacts of a gender quota for male primary school teachers in Finland on their pupils' long run outcomes.
