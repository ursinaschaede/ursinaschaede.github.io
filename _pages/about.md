## Welcome!

<br/>
I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Economics at Tufts University. As an applied microeconomist, I study labor markets with a focus on education and gender. 

I was previously a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Economics at MIT. I hold a PhD in Economics from the University of Zurich and a Masters in Public Policy from the University of Chicago.
