## Welcome!

<br/>
I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Economics at Tufts University. As an applied microeconomist, I study labor markets with a focus on education and gender. 

I was previously a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Economics at MIT. I obtained a PhD in Economics at the University of Zurich and a Masters in Public Policy at the University of Chicago.
