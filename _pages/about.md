<br/><br/>

## Welcome!

<br/>
I am a PhD candidate at the Economics department at the University of Zurich.

As an applied microeconomist, I study labor markets with a focus on education and gender. In my job market paper,
I analyze the long term impacts of a gender quota for male primary school teachers in Finland on their pupils' long run outcomes.


I will be a Swiss National Science Foundation PostDoc for 2022/23 and subsequently join the department of Economics at Tufts University.
